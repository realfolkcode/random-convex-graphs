# Random Convex Graphs

Random graphs generated by the Erdős–Rényi model are not globally convex as was shown by [Tilen Marc and LovroˇSubelj](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.03402.pdf). We propose an algorithm for the randomized convex graph generation. It deploys preferential attachment at its core, allowing generated graphs to be close to scale-free networks.
